# MoonWalker-Collision
This project aims to improve and further Digital Twin Interoperability by exploring interaction and collision between two separate entities from two different simulation platforms. In our use case, we utilized NVIDIA Omniverse and Unity as our simulation platforms, having one rover for each. NVIDIA Omniverse hosted the Cadre rover while Unity hosted the Viper rover. This document summarizes the requirements for the Digital Twin Interoperability Collision Experiments to be recreated.

 # Requirements
 ## NVIDIA Omniverse
 1. Computer specifications outlined by NVIDIA Omniverse: [Omniverse Requirements](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/dev-guide/latest/common/technical-requirements.html)
 2. Python 3.12+
 3. Python libraries: omniverse_kit, requests, pxr, charset_normalizer, idna, urllib, usd core
## Unity
 1. Computer specifications outlined by Unity: [Unity Requirements](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/system-requirements.html)
 2. C#
 3. VSCode

## HSML API
1. Docker — Used to run the HSML API’s internal services.
2. MySQL (internal to HSML API) — Used by the HSML API for validation/verification data storage (not accessed directly by the simulations).
3. Kafka (internal to HSML API) — Used by the HSML API for validation/verification message streaming (producer/consumer).

# Required Scripts
## NVIDIA Omniverse
1. CadreAOmniAPIJSON.py: requests to the HSML API and sends data about Cadre from Omniverse
2. CadreAOmni_ConsumerAPIJSON.py: requests to the HSML and reads in data about Cadre from Unity for Unity hosting
3. ViperAOmniAPIJSON.py: requests to the HSML API and reads in data about Cadre from Unity for Unity hosting
4. rover_generalizer_final.py: takes in a rover prim and generalizes it for Omniverse hosting
5. collision_HSML.py: handles collision detection and hosting switch for rover.
## Unity
1. Viper: Asset with Mesh, Collider, & Rigidbody functionality.
2. Cadre: Asset with Mesh. Collider and Rigidbody created on collision only.
3. Lunar Surface: Asset for DT Lunar Surface Exploration.

## HSML API
1. hsml_api: Runs validation/verification and acts as the main endpoint both simulation platforms connect to. It receives real-time rover movement/physics data and routes it through the API’s internal services (including Kafka) for processing.
2. HSML-Form-Website: Used to register Spatial Web entities (e.g., rovers, agents, users, organizations) so they can be recognized and managed by the HSML system.

# Required USD/FBX files
## NVIDIA Omniverse
1. Viper Substance File (1).fbx
2. 4WD_Contrl.usd
3. CADREDEMO.usd
4. MAINDEMO.usd
5. Shackleton Ridge 300x300 v4 -001.usd
## Unity
1. fill out

# Usage
## NVIDIA Omniverse
1. Open up NVIDIA Omniverse
2. Run rover_generalizier.py to generalize the rover stage tree structure
3. Open 3 command prompts, one for each of the following scripts:
    - CadreAOmniAPIJSON.py
    - CadreAOmni_ConsumerAPIJSON.py
    - ViperAOmniAPIJSON.py
4. Run the scripts above and press play on NVIDIA Omniverse
## Unity
## HSML API
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Open 2 Ubuntu Terminals to run the hsml_api and HSML-Form-Website:
3. In **Terminal 1**, go to the `hsml_api` directory and start the internal services:
   ```bash
   cd hsml_api
   docker-compose up
4. In **Terminal 2**, go to the `HSML-Form-Website` directory and start the from app via Docker:
   ```bash
   cd HSML-Form-Website

   docker build -t hsml-form .

   docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 hsml-form

 5. Now Docker Containers are in Docker so they can be run from inside Docker next time
